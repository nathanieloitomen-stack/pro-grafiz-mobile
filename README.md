# Pro_Grafiz

Digital design-to-fabrication platform for Pro_Grafiz Designs Ltd (metal
laser cutting and fabrication, seven customer centres, Abuja and Lagos).

This repository is the **production build**, distinct from the approved
design handoff prototype (`Pro_Grafiz App.dc.html` and its README), which
remains the UX/visual reference only and is not committed here.

## Start here

1. Read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) — non-negotiable engineering rules and
   working protocol for anyone (human or AI agent) working in this repo.
2. Read [`PRO_GRAFIZ_MASTER_SPEC.md`](./PRO_GRAFIZ_MASTER_SPEC.md) — the
   authoritative production architecture, schema, business rules, and
   task sequence (PG-001 … PG-018).
3. Read [`docs/`](./docs) for the working detail behind each area
   (architecture, schema, API, security, testing, deployment).

## Status

**PG-001 (Foundation), PG-002 (Design System), PG-003 (Database), and
PG-004 (Authentication) complete.** Staff PIN sign-in (Supabase
Auth-backed) and customer phone-OTP sign-in are wired end-to-end — see
[`docs/authentication.md`](./docs/authentication.md) for the design
decisions. **No RLS yet (PG-005)** — every table is still wide open on
a real deployment; do not point this at a live Supabase project until
that lands. No payment integration, no feature screens exist yet. See
[`PRO_GRAFIZ_MASTER_SPEC.md`](./PRO_GRAFIZ_MASTER_SPEC.md#17-development-sequence)
for the full task sequence. Do not implement tasks beyond the currently
authorized one in a single pass.

## Local setup (once tooling is available)

This scaffold was authored without network access, so dependency
manifests are declared but not installed and no lockfiles are committed.
Before development:

```bash
# Mobile
cd apps/mobile && flutter pub get

# Admin web
cd apps/admin-web && npm install

# Supabase (local)
supabase start
```

Verify tool versions against `apps/mobile/pubspec.yaml` and
`apps/admin-web/package.json` and update pinned versions if newer stable
releases exist — they were not checked against a live registry when this
scaffold was created.
